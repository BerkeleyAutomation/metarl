# metarl
Meta RL Project

The `rl` folder has policies and experiment setup from RLPy. The `rlgym` folder has all of the rllab stuff. There are a few changes we need to make to rllab in order for this to work, mainly to utilize parallel computation ... will provide a patch somehow later.

Dependencies should be limited to the following on pip:
 - `gym`
 - `rllab`
 - `rlpy`
